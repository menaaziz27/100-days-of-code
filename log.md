# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I learned about difference between percentages and fixed width in CSS.

Also learned about NoSQL relationships, some mongoDB query modifiers (limit - skip), and update operators ($lte - $gte - $in - $text) and search indexing.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the CSS part cuz I'm a CSS noob, and I think im familiar with different relationships in mongoDB as well and I've leveled my skills up :grin:.

**Link to work:** [MongoDB relationships](https://github.com/menaaziz27/MongoDB-relationships)

**Link to work:** [responsive layouts day 1](https://github.com/menaaziz27/conquer-responsive-layouts/tree/master/Day1)
